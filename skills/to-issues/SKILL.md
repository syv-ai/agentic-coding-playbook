# To Issues

Break a plan into independently-grabbable issues using vertical slices (tracer bullets).

## Where the issues go

By default, the project tracks issues on **GitHub via the `gh` CLI**. Publish each slice as a new GitHub issue with `gh issue create`.

**Fallback:** if `gh` is not available, or the repo has no GitHub remote, write each issue as a markdown file under `docs/issues/<slug>.md` instead (where `<slug>` is a short kebab-case name for the slice). Tell the user where you wrote them.

No triage labels are required — just create the issues/files.

If the project has a `CONTEXT.md`, glossary, or similar, use its vocabulary in issue titles and descriptions.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes an issue reference (issue number, URL, or path) as an argument, fetch it (`gh issue view <number>`, or read the file) and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' or 'AFK'. HITL slices require human interaction, such as an architectural decision or a design review. AFK slices can be implemented and merged without human interaction. Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses (if the source material has them)

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?
- Are the correct slices marked as HITL and AFK?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the issues

For each approved slice, publish a new issue using the issue body template below. By default, create it on GitHub with `gh issue create`; in the fallback case, write it to `docs/issues/<slug>.md`.

Publish issues in dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real issue identifiers (issue numbers, or file paths in the fallback case) in the "Blocked by" field.

<issue-template>
## Parent

A reference to the parent issue (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit this section).

## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

Avoid specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it here and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Blocked by

- A reference to the blocking ticket (if any)

Or "None - can start immediately" if no blockers.

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.
